# What is this?

Using Google Map's API integration with React.js I was able to create a real-estate search platform with some data to query. Inspired by the webste design by Trulia and Zillow, I wanted to create something similar with my current understanding of web technologies. 


# What did I learn?
- Learned how to combined CSS grid and flexbox together to create a complex layout for this project.
- Learned how Google Map API is integrated with React.js via documentation.
- Learned how to style a complex layout similar to websites like zillow and trulia.

# Features to add for improvement:

  - Filter component for price, apartment type, and bedroom.
  - When user hovers a home on the listings section, create a unique key to associate each home on the map and color code which one it is on the map.
